DEPRECATED since November 2007: use webtest.xml instead of this file!

        This project provides following elements to use in your test scripts:

        (0) all webtest's steps loaded and ready to use,
        (1) the path "webtest.path.id" that includes all of webtest's libraries,
        (2) the class loader "webtest.loader" that is the original loader for webtest.

        Usage:
        Set the property webtest.home to the directory in which the build.zip is extracted,
        and calls:
        &lt;import file="${webtest.home}/lib/taskdef.xml" &gt;
    </description>
